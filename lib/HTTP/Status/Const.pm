=head1 NAME

HTTP::Status::Const - interpolable HTTP status constants

=for readme plugin version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HTTP::Status::Const;

  ...

  $response->status( $HTTP_NOT_FOUND );

  ...

  my %handlers = (
    $HTTP_OK      => sub { ... },
    $HTTP_CREATED => sub { ... },
    ...
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is basically a wrapper around L<HTTP::Status> that allows
you to use the constants as read-only scalar variables instead of
function names.

This means the constants can be used in contexts where you need
interpolated variables, such as hash keys or in strings.

=head2 Do I really need this?

No. You can get interpolated constants already, with some ugly syntax:

  my %handlers = (
    HTTP_OK() => sub { ... },
  );

or

  "Status code ${ \HTTP_OK }"

So all this module gives you is some stylistic convenience, at the
expense of additional dependencies (although ones that may be used
by other modules).

=head1 EXPORTS

By default, only the HTTP constants are exported.

For convenience, the tags from L<HTTP::Status> are supported so that
the C<:is> and C<status_message> functions are exported.
